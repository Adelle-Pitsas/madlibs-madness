## About the Project
This project was created with React that uses a lightweight Express.js backend [https://github.com/Adelle-Pitsas/madlibs-api] and tests end-to-end with Cypress. The user can play madlibs by entering words as they are prompted in the `Play` view, and then see the result of their mystery madlib when you submit all of their words. The user can then favorite a madlib and see it in their favorites view. If they want to play again, they can simply made a new madlib and continue the fun. This app uses GET, POST, and DELETE network requests.

## The App


### Context
This project is a solo project completed in January 2023, about 5 months into a career change into front-end software development. The goals for this project were:
1. To use React, Router, e2e testing with Cypress
2. Create a lightweight backend with Express.js
3. Create personas and user stories that describe the target audience
4. Work within constraints to deliver a product for my audience
5. Manipulates data access from an API


## Getting Started
### Installation
1. Fork this Repo
1. Clone it down to your machine
1. cd into the root of th eproject directory
1. Run npm install
1. Run npm start and you will see a line similar to: `Project is running at http://localhost:8080/`
1. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to see the client side running
1. For the functionality to run correctly, follow steps 2 - 5 for this local api server: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api . Make sure to clone outside of the Whistledown Inn directory. Run this server in a seperate tab of your terminal.  
1. Enter ctrl + c anytime to stop either of the servers.

## Wins and Challenges
#### Wins:
- Learned some cool CSS to increase my UI (overlays, popups, dropdowns, animations)
- I had some fun planning the class logic and deciding where pieces of the logic puzzle should go
- Nitpicking user actions for seamless user interactions
- Successful (and relatively painless) `get` and `post` requests
- Fixing, making note of, and solving bugs as they came up

#### Challenges:
- Formatting the background picture
- More than just a smidge of self-doubt about how I approached certain problems. I enjoy solo projects, but I love the more realistic group collaboration/mentor-question-asking environments more!
